nes15 - by Mathew Brenaman

	nes15 is an implementation of the classic Fifteen Puzzle for the
	Nintendo Entertainment System. This version is an NROM-128 (16kb
	PRG, 8kb CHR) and was tested on the real system with a PowerPak. It
	should also work with most emulators such as Nestopia and FCE Ultra.

	The fifteen puzzle consists of a frame of numbered square tiles in
	random order with one tile missing. The object of the puzzle is to
	place the tiles in order by sliding them into the empty position:

		1   2   3   4

		5   6   7   8

		9  10  11  12

		13 14  15  --

	If you become frustrated trying solve the puzzle, I've implemented
	an auto-solver that allows you to watch it be solved. While the
	auto-solver does not always make the least amount of moves needed
	to solve the puzzle, it should always at least solve it.

	This program is free software. It is distributed under the terms
	of a simple BSD-style license (OSI-approved). See the 'LICENSE'
	file for details.

How to play
-----------

	At the title screen, pressing any button will began play.

	Game controls:

	Directional buttons:	Move the cursor
	A:			Slide the tile under cursor into the gap
	Start:			Pause the game
	Select:			Toggle the auto-solver

	After the puzzle has been completed by either you or the auto-solver,
	press either A or B and new puzzle will be generated.



Compiling
---------

	You will need ca65, a macro assembler included with cc65, which
	can be found at:
	http://www.cc65.org/

	You will also need to compile and locally install the tools provided.

	If you are using Linux or something similar, simply running 'make'
	should produce the NTSC ROM image. If you wish to build the PAL
	version, run 'make PAL=1'.

	For other OS's, you will need to do a bit of fiddling with the
	makefile and other witchery which I will not cover here.

	The Font used for the digits on puzzle tiles is from what I believe
	is an old DOS font, which can be found at:
	http://orangetide.com/nesdev/gamefonts/

	And possibly also at:
	http://chris.pirillo.com/dos-fonts/


	The font used, titled "Ghost", I found here:
	http://kofler.dot.at/c64/

	It's seems to actually be the font used in the Commodore 64 version
	of "Ghosts and Goblins".


	The music is from "Eight Short Preludes and Fugues" by J.S. Bach
	(possibly by J.T. Krebs), BWV 558.
