This is an NES demo that I made to show off some of the NES' features.
It doesn't do too much that resembles an actual game, but it should give
you an idea of what the NES can do technically.  Besides, I'm proud of
what I did, since I'm a beginner at NES (and 6502) programming.

This demo, called "Stars SE" is a tribute to the NES and NES games of
the past.  It's also a little tip of the hat to the C-64-style intros.
I have included the source code to this version of Stars, but the music
is not included, as I did not write it.

I've tried to code this demo by the book, without using any bad tricks
(since I don't really know any tricks anyway).  A _good_ NES emulator,
that is, one that behaves closest to a real NES, should have no problem
running this thing.

Please E-Mail me if you like this demo.  Enjoy!
