SNOW intro, by Repulse (Tennessee Carmel-Veilleux)
==================================================

Introduction
------------
During the past year, I've worked very hard to learn 6502 assembly and
ultimately, NES programming. What this archive contains is my first
release. It is an Intro called "SNOW". It is the first "real" NES intro in
the Demoparty sense of the word. Let's not forget that other devoted
people have also given time to NES programming:

 -Memblers
 -Yoshi
 -Matt Conte
 -Kevin Horton
 -The A/NES crew
 -Chris Covell

and have succeded by bringing technical demonstrations.

The people
----------
 -Repulse : Code, design
 -_Bnu    : GFX
 -Memblers: Music
 -Bananmos: Music Engine/Tracker
 -Random  : Original music in MOD format

Distribution License
--------------------
You can distribute this intro far and wide in both ROM and Cartridge form.
HOWEVER, you cannot sell the data itself, you can only sell the medium.
If you see this rule broken by someone, don't forget to e-mail me :) The
sources will ONLY be available at Yoshi's NES developement site, which is,
BTW, PRIVATE and restricted to the few who can actually make use of it.
Any outside distribution of the source will result in a suit for breach of
contract (to which you are agreeing by downloading this package). In other
words, if you have the source, don't give it to someone else without
asking me first. This is to insure that the NES developement community
doesn't suffer the same lame-fest that the NES emulation scene is
suffering right now. As usual, I cannot be held responsible for physical
or moral harm caused to you or your equipment.

Technical data about this intro
-------------------------------
Run this intro in the LATEST LoopyNES for the greatest experience :)

This intro was coded using the following software:

CA65/LD65: Assembler and Linker from Ulrich von Bassewitz
   -> Available at http://www.von-bassewitz.de/uz/cc65/

TLayer, NES Screen Arranger from Kent Hansen (Snowbro)
   -> Available at (His page is down :( Zophar's Domain

NT2 from Michael Iwaniec (Bananmos)
   -> Available on request

The demo took approx 30-40 hours to code spanned across 6 months (60% of
the coding was done the week before Coma '99). It contains > 2500 lines of
code. It was coded 100% under Linux.
