Duelito (The Duel)

Playing is easy. Just move to left and right, and press A for jump.


Note: NESticle makes the floor to appear lower. As it is the most
popular emulator, the game is adapted to it and is supposed to
look correctly, but in other emulators or different versions of
NESticle it may look bad.
